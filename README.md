## What is This?

The UX SDK is a suite of product agnostic UI objects that fast tracks the development of Android applications using the [DJI Mobile SDK](http://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/).

## Integration

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.dji</groupId>

</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.dji</groupId>
    <artifactId>dji-sdk-provided</artifactId>
    <version>4.10</version>
</dependency>
~~~

or Gradle:
